1.	What work did I contribute to the team to complete this project?  This can be answered by stating what code you completed.  Also state what other tangible ways you contributed to help complete the project?
I managed everything when Aajinkya was away, I completed most of the classes and kept everyone on track. I made the text based pong game. I made the UI, the income and expenses tracker, the shop that randomly generates parts every day, the orders that take time to ship, the random events that happen every time a day occurs, most of the parts, the unlocking logic for games needing minimum system requirements to play. I also posted the project on github so that everyone can see the current state of the project and download it on their respective devices.

2.	Choose at least one class you created and describe in detail its purpose.  Describe in detail how/why you put your code together?  How did this class fit into the overall purpose of the project?  What could you have done differently in creation/use of this class?

The Supplier class in my computer shop simulation game represents a supplier responsible for storing the supplier's name, managing the available inventory of parts, handling special deals or discounts, and generating a list of random parts to simulate inventory. The class includes attributes such as name, availableParts, discountRate, and hasSpecialDeal, along with constructors for default and custom initialization, standard getters and setters for encapsulation, and additional methods like generateRandomParts, getRandomQuality, and applyDiscount. The Supplier class integrates with other components like the Store class, providing a source of parts for the store to purchase and sell, thus simulating real-world supplier interactions. Potential improvements include dynamic inventory management, enhanced discount logic, supplier relationships, and implementing interfaces for modular code. This class adds realism and challenge to the game by creating variety in parts and discounts, enhancing the overall player experience.
