1.	What work did I contribute to the team to complete this project?  This can be answered by stating what code you completed.  Also state what other tangible ways you contributed to help complete the project?
I managed everything when Aajinkya was away, I completed most of the classes and kept everyone on track. I made the text based pong game. I made the UI, the income and expenses tracker, the shop that randomly generates parts every day, the orders that take time to ship, the random events that happen every time a day occurs, most of the parts, the unlocking logic for games needing minimum system requirements to play. I also posted the project on github so that everyone can see the current state of the project and download it on their respective devices.

2.	Choose at least one class you created and describe in detail its purpose.  Describe in detail how/why you put your code together?  How did this class fit into the overall purpose of the project?  What could you have done differently in creation/use of this class?   
If you only contributed to the test class, then what was the purpose of the test class (in context of you setting up your shop)?  Give some detail of the code that was put together for some part you deem as important in the test class.
